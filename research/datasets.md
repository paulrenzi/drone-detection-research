| **RWDA** (rotary-wing drone acoustic) | Drone sounds + natural environmental noise, open field | IEEE DataPort | Robust detection in noise |
| **Multiclass acoustic drone dataset** (2025) | 3,200 recordings from 32 UAV types, ~16,000 s | arXiv 2509.04715 | Multi-class identification |
| **Drone Sound Audio Detection** | Binary drone / unknown | Kaggle | Baseline classifier |
| **Sara Al-Emadi drone audio dataset** | Early drone audio corpus | Public | Baseline |
| **AcousticPrint** | 5 commercial drones recorded at ~20 m, 4 more from YouTube, plus vehicles, bees and speech as negatives | No licence stated; ask the authors before reuse | Open-set rejection of unknown sounds; see [Open-source projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link research/open-source-builds.md %}#acousticprint) |
| **Western Sydney 24-mic localization** | Multi-mic recordings with GPS flight logs | Research release | Testing bearings and triangulation offline |

## The real gap

{: .warning }
> The original framing mentions an open-source drone sound library from **Ukraine and Norway**. We have **not** yet found it. Candidates to check: Squarehead (Norway) publications, Ukrainian volunteer projects (Zvook, Sky Fortress), NATO/DIANA challenges. **Add the link here once found.**

- Public datasets are mostly small hobby/commercial quadcopters.
- **Shahed/Geran, Lancet and fibre-optic FPV recordings** are what a military customer cares about, and they are scarce publicly. This is likely the true data bottleneck; partnering with a Ukrainian or Baltic program for recordings matters more than any model architecture.
- **Collecting our own:** the open-source [Batear]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link research/open-source-builds.md %}#batear) detector can save the audio around each alarm to an SD card, a cheap way to gather labelled field recordings.
- **Negative data** (mopeds, chainsaws, generators, tractors, aircraft, wind, rain) from the actual deployment region is just as important, to keep false alarms down.
