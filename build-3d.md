The [tripwire]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link index.md %}) depends on a drone carrying listeners forward and dropping them so they stand up and listen. These are the models of that hardware: one listener (the **dart**), the **harness** that holds and releases four of them, both on a Holybro X500, and a **stake mount** for placing a listener by hand. Each model plays its assembly on its own: press **Pause** to stop it, then rotate, zoom, or drag the slider to take it apart by hand. Point at a part to name it; click it for its mass and what it does. Every printed part is [downloadable](#8-downloads) as STL and STEP.

{: .warning }
> **A computer model, not a tested design.** Nothing here has been printed, assembled, dropped or flown. The bought parts are the manufacturers' own CAD where it exists (the X500 frame, the Seeed XIAO ESP32S3 and Wio-SX1262 boards), and every other dimension comes from a datasheet or is flagged *measure*. Masses are computed from the model's geometry. The open question is whether a dart released sideways from the drone turns nose-down and sticks in soil with the microphone working, and no model answers it. The weighted [dummy](#5-the-drop-test-dummy) dropped from the drone does.

## 1. One dart

<div class="cad-viewer" data-src="{{ web }}dart.glb" data-manifest="{{ web }}manifest.json" data-model="dart"></div>

**A rod, a body and a pod.** The cell sits near the tip, the board and mic in the pod at the top, and four fins steer it point-first as it falls.

<details class="layer" markdown="block">
<summary><span class="layer-title">The detail</span><span class="layer-sub">Parts, masses, the balance point, and why it should fall point first</span></summary>

A 0.24 × 20 in fibreglass rod is the spike, the spine and the mast. Three printed parts sit on it. The **body**, near the tip, holds the 18650 cell in snap fingers and carries the hanger post the harness grips. The **pod**, on the top end, is a small tray and a screwed lid. It holds the XIAO ESP32S3 with the Wio-SX1262 radio board plugged on top, the microphone behind a side port, and the kit's two flat antennas: the LoRa one on a strip that runs past the pod, the WiFi one inside. Between them, the **tail**: four thin fins on two collars glued to the rod, to make the dart fall point first. Two wires run along the rod from the cell to pads under the XIAO.

The pod has no screen and no status light. The listener reports by radio once a minute that it is alive. A small printed **cap** on the pod's end comes off to reach the USB-C port for flashing, and a pin through the same opening presses BOOT or RESET, so the lid stays shut.

The model lies flat, the way it is carried. Exploded, the body slides off toward the tip and the pod slides off the rod end. The cell and the lid lift away, and the screws, inserts, seals and foam pads separate so each can be seen.

- **Model mass: 5.9 oz,** of which the tail is 0.64 oz. The cell is 1.6 oz (datasheet maximum), the body 1.5 oz, the rod 0.93 oz, the pod tray, lid and cap 0.90 oz, the two boards 0.14 oz, and screws, wire, antennas and seals the rest. Printed masses assume solid PETG at 100% infill. Nothing has been weighed.
- **The hanger is at the model's balance point,** 10.9 in from the tip and offset 0.24 in toward the cell, because the cell sits beside the rod and not on it.
- **Standing in soil,** the tip goes in 2.8 in and the sound port is 19.7 in above the ground. The whole dart is 27 in from tip to antenna. The LoRa antenna's size is a placeholder until the real one is measured, and it is why the dart is longer than before.

### Why it should fall point first

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/dart_balance.png" alt="Side cutaway of the dart, tip on the left: the 18650 cell in gold near the tip, the balance point at 10.891 in, the centre of pressure at 11.854 in without fins and 13.951 in with them, and the four fins farther back toward the pod" width="100%"></p>

A dart steers itself the way a lawn dart or a shuttlecock does. Its weight sits near the point, and the air pushes hardest on it farther back, so a tilted dart is turned point-first by the air it falls through. The farther back that push sits behind the balance point, the stronger the turn. Most of the weight is the 18650 cell, which sits in the body near the tip, 4.3 in from it.

| GPT-6.1's estimate | Without fins | With fins |
|---|---|---|
| Dart mass | 5.22 oz | 5.91 oz |
| Balance point, from the tip | 10.02 in | 10.89 in |
| Centre of air pressure, from the tip | 11.85 in | 13.95 in |
| Gap between them | 1.84 in, 1.25 body widths | 3.06 in, 2.08 body widths |

- **The fins:** four trapezoids, 6.46 in long and 0.59 in tall, 0.047 in thick, keyed into two printed collars and glued to the rod. They are long and low because there is no room for taller ones: the closest a fin comes to the next dart's pod during release is 0.056 in. They print flat, without supports. Being glued, they come off only by breaking the bond.
- **The target was 2 body widths** of gap, and the fins reach 2.08. That is a rule of thumb for a clear margin, not a proven requirement. The estimate treats the dart's side view as a cardboard cut-out with even pressure on it, not a wind-tunnel number.
- **The dart is still carried flat,** hung at its balance point. Hanging it off the balance point would start it tilted, but it would tilt the wrong way if hung toward the point: the point rises, not falls. Hung toward the tail, the point drops, but either offset jams the hanger's head against the release rotor. So it leaves level and the air has to turn it, and how soon is not known.

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/dart_fall_sequence.png" alt="Schematic, not a simulation: the dart leaving flat, turning, nose-down in still air, and tilted about 18 degrees into a 10 mph wind" width="100%"></p>

**In wind it lands tilted.** A finned dart points along the air it falls through, so in a crosswind the point leans upwind. Ignoring drag, the lean from vertical is about:

| Drop | 5 mph wind | 10 mph wind | 15 mph wind |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| 16 ft | 13° | 25° | 34° |
| 33 ft | 9° | 18° | 26° |
| 49 ft | 7° | 15° | 21° |

That is arithmetic, not a test. Drag slows the fall, which steepens the lean, but it also carries the dart downwind, which reduces it, and which wins needs a real drop. The fins may also not finish turning the dart in a short drop. None of this shows that a dart lands upright or survives landing: the [dummy](#5-the-drop-test-dummy), with the same fins, is what will tell.

</details>

## 2. The harness, loaded with four darts

<div class="cad-viewer" data-src="{{ web }}harness.glb" data-manifest="{{ web }}manifest.json" data-model="harness"></div>

**One servo, one rotor.** Each 16° step lines a gap in the rotor up with one dart's head, and that dart drops.

<details class="layer" markdown="block">
<summary><span class="layer-title">The detail</span><span class="layer-sub">How it releases, masses, and what still has to be measured</span></summary>

One printed plate is zip-tied to the X500's two payload rails at four saddles. An SG90 servo hangs under the plate and turns a printed **rotor** on top of it. Each dart's hanger post comes up through a slot in the plate, and its round head rests on the rotor's rim. The rim has four gaps at different angles. Each 16° servo step lines one gap up with one head, and that dart drops: the inner pair first, then the outer pair.

The darts' weight bears on a ridge on the plate, faced with PTFE tape, not on the servo. A loose keeper washer above the rotor stops it lifting off. Exploded, the keeper lifts first, then the rotor and the servo horn. The servo drops below the plate and the four darts drop below that in two tiers. The harness itself did not change for the new board; its fits were rechecked against the finned darts and their moved hangers.

- **Model mass: 6.5 oz without darts**: plate 4.6 oz, rotor 1.4 oz, servo and horn about 0.32 oz (catalogue), plus fasteners and ties.
- **Four darts plus the harness: 1.9 lb** (1.88 lb), up from 1.7 lb before the fins. That is the payload the X500 has to carry on top of its own battery and avionics. Whether it carries it well is a flight test, not a model result.
- **The rotor's fit and the servo's torque are calculations.** The real breakaway torque has to be measured with the PTFE tape and all four darts loaded. Stall torque is not a torque a servo can hold continuously.

</details>

## 3. On the drone

<div class="cad-viewer" data-src="{{ web }}aircraft.glb" data-manifest="{{ web }}manifest.json" data-model="aircraft"></div>

**Nothing overlaps when carried.** The lowest dart rides 3.7 in above the ground on stock skids; the fall itself is untested.

<details class="layer" markdown="block">
<summary><span class="layer-title">The detail</span><span class="layer-sub">The clearance checks and what the model does not show</span></summary>

The Holybro X500 V2 is the manufacturer's own STEP model, simplified for the web. The translucent discs are the propellers' swept area, used for the clearance check, not blade models. Exploded, the whole payload lowers 16 in clear of the airframe, then opens as in the harness view.

- **In the carried state nothing overlaps:** darts, frame, rails, clamps, motors, prop discs, landing legs or each other, at the nominal dimensions. The lowest dart is 3.7 in above the ground plane of the stock skids.
- **The model checks a clear path out, not the fall.** It checks each dart, fins included, sliding 3.5 in straight down through its gap, and a nose-down rotation once a dart is 17 in below the drone. It does not show that a real dart waits that long before it tips, or that it lands upright. The fins' [estimate](#why-it-should-fall-point-first) is the only word on the fall so far.

</details>

## 4. The stake listener

<div class="cad-viewer" data-src="{{ web }}stake.glb" data-manifest="{{ web }}manifest.json" data-model="stake"></div>

**The same pod on a 48 in garden stake,** for placing a listener by hand with no drone.

<details class="layer" markdown="block">
<summary><span class="layer-title">The detail</span><span class="layer-sub">The stake adapter, cell holder and mass</span></summary>

For placing a listener by hand, with no drone. The same pod, board and cell go on a 48 in fibreglass garden stake from a hardware store. A printed **stake adapter** holds the pod: two V-shaped saddles and zip ties grip any stake from 0.31 to 0.51 in across, so the stake's exact size doesn't matter. A 1.6 in offcut of the dart rod plugs the adapter into the pod's usual socket. A separate printed **cell holder**, tied lower on the stake, holds the 18650, wired to the board as in the dart.

Push the stake in by hand, then slide the adapter until the microphone is 19.7 in above the ground; how deep the stake goes doesn't change that. Exploded, the pod pulls off its offcut.

- **Model mass: 10.9 oz** for the whole installation, stake and cell included. Nothing on the stake flies, so this is not drone payload.

<details class="layer" id="5-the-drop-test-dummy" markdown="block">
<summary><span class="layer-title">5. The drop-test dummy</span><span class="layer-sub">An inert dart ballasted to the real one's mass and balance, for the first drops</span></summary>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/dummy_assembled.png" alt="The inert dummy dart standing in soil: the same rod, hanger and pod as a real dart, with a ballast box where the cell would be" width="300"></p>

The first test is a drop, and a dummy is cheaper to break. It uses the same rod, hanger, fins, pod shell, lid, cap and antenna strip as a real dart, with no cell, board or microphone. Steel ballast in four printed pockets, two in the body and two in the pod, brings it to the real dart's mass and balance point.

- **Ballast: 1.3 oz of steel** in all, weighed out into four portions (nuts or washers work), held still with foam. The empty dummy is 4.6 oz; with ballast it matches the real dart's 5.9 oz and its balance point.
- **Weigh the printed dummy first,** then re-solve the ballast with the real numbers. The model's match is only as good as its estimates.
- **What the drops answer:** whether the dart turns nose-down, when it starts to turn, whether it sticks, and whether the snaps, post and rod survive.

<details class="layer" id="7-what-the-model-does-and-does-not-show" markdown="block">
<summary><span class="layer-title">7. What the model does and does not show</span><span class="layer-sub">What is computed, what is measured, and what only a test can say</span></summary>

**What it shows:** every part at a sourced or flagged size, fitting together without overlap in the carried, releasing and standing states, on the stake, and with the dummy's ballast in its pockets. Those are GPT-6.1's 164 generated checks, and they test the model against itself. It also shows the order the parts go together, and a mass for everything.

**What it does not show:**

- **That a dart lands upright.** The darts are carried flat. The fins come with an estimate of where the air pushes, not a model of the fall: nothing here shows the turn nose-down, how long it takes, or 2.8 in of rod going into real soil. This is the first test: print the [dummy](#5-the-drop-test-dummy) and drop it from the drone's release height again and again.
- **That the microphone hears a drone through the pod.** The side port, film and cavity are built from TDK's sealing guidance, but they have never been recorded through.
- **That the pod keeps water out.** It is a printed box with a cord seal and a sealed cap. The seal's squeeze is calculated, not tested.
- **That the X500 flies well with 1.9 lb under it.**
- **About 60 dimensions marked *measure*:** how far apart the two boards sit when plugged together, the antennas, the microphone breakout, the servo's spline and screw thread, and the print fits. They have to be checked with calipers on the bought parts and a printed fit coupon before the real print.
- **The animation is an assembly diagram.** It slides rigid parts apart. It does not show screws turning, ties being cut, inserts being heated in, or the servo's real release sequence.

- **Still renders:** [dart exploded]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/dart_exploded.png), [pod exploded]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/dart_exploded_pod.png), [USB access]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/pod_usb_access.png), [harness exploded]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/harness_exploded.png), [on the drone]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/aircraft_exploded.png), [stake]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/stake_assembled.png), [dummy ballast]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/dummy_ballast_detail.png), [balance]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/dart_balance.png), [fins]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/dart_fins_detail.png), [fall, schematic]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/gpt61/renders/dart_fall_sequence.png), and all 38 in [`REVIEW.html`](https://github.com/paulrenzi/tripwire/blob/main/cad/gpt61/REVIEW.html). Every label is in inches and ounces; the STL and STEP files stay in millimetres, as slicers expect.
- **Print files and design notes:** STL and STEP for every printed part, and the print settings, sources and assembly steps, in [`cad/gpt61/`](https://github.com/paulrenzi/tripwire/tree/main/cad/gpt61). Start with [`DESIGN.md`](https://github.com/paulrenzi/tripwire/blob/main/cad/gpt61/DESIGN.md).
- **Who made it:** GPT-6.1, run as an agent through the Codex CLI on 2026-10-15 and 10-16 from a written brief, and again on 2026-10-21 to rebuild it round the XIAO kit ([brief](https://github.com/paulrenzi/tripwire/blob/main/cad/gpt61/BRIEF-xiao.md)). The CAD is CadQuery (Python). Rebuild the viewer models with `cad/gpt61/web_export.py`.
- **The older designs** (v1–v3, hand-built boxes and cylinders) are on [Build: hardware]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link build-hardware.md %}). This model replaces their geometry, not their concept.
