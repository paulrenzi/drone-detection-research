<p class="vz-lede">The tripwire warns. This section asks what the warning can <em>do</em>, without anyone standing up to shoot. <strong>Today a fibre-optic FPV is often stopped with a shotgun at close range.</strong> Its weak point is the hair-thin line it leaves lying on the ground behind it.</p>

<summary><span class="layer-title">Why go after the fibre</span><span class="layer-sub">Why the line is the weak point, and what a cut does</span></summary>

**Jammers can't touch a fibre FPV, but its line can be cut.** It is steered and sees through a glass fibre about 0.01 in thick (0.25–0.28 mm) that it pays out behind it, 6–30 mi of it on a spool ([Made-in-China listing](https://fibconet.en.made-in-china.com/product/VaKRyjNAyCkS/China-Drone-Fiber-Optic-0-27mm-Outer-Diameter-G657A2-Cable-Fpv-Fiber-Optic-Bare-Cable.html), [Zion](https://www.zion-communication.com/90KM-FPV-Drone-Fiber-Optic-Spool-FPV-Drone-Anti-Jamming-Optical-Fiber-Link-pd504050048.html)). The line isn't carried through the air. It lies on the ground and the vegetation behind the drone ([Militarnyi](https://militarnyi.com/en/news/russians-discover-ukrainian-solution-to-fiber-optic-drones/)), so anything low across the drone's path ends up under it.

**It breaks easily.** The glass is proof-tested at about 100 kpsi ([Corning](https://www.corning.com/content/dam/corning/microsites/coc/oem/documents/specialty-fiber/AN7080-Determining-the-Appropriate-Prrof-Test-Level-for-G.pdf)). On a 125 µm fibre that is about 8.5 N, or 1.9 lbf (our arithmetic). Vendors claim 50–60 N, about 11–13 lbf, for their FPV fibre (unverified).

**What a cut does depends on the drone:**
- **With no radio backup, it goes dark.** The crew loses video and control. The drone has no return-to-home, so it comes down where it is, sometimes still carrying its warhead ([DroneXL](https://dronexl.co/2026/03/23/ukraine-fiber-optic-fpv-drones-radio-cable/)).
- **With a radio backup, it switches to radio.** Ukraine has tested a dual-link FPV that costs about $60 more (UAH 2,500), and Logika says many Russian fibre FPVs carry one ([RFE/RL](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-invasion-fpv-drone-defence-cable-cutting-chaharnyk/33867913.html)). On radio, the drone is open to jamming again. A cut and the unit's jammer work together: the cut forces the drone onto the radio, and the jammer takes it down.
- **Too late if it's already diving.** A Chinese assessment of a similar fence noted that a cut doesn't stop the drone's momentum ([RFE/RL](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-invasion-fpv-drone-defence-cable-cutting-chaharnyk/33867913.html)). The cut has to come well before the drone reaches its target. We found no source on fibre FPVs locking onto a target and finishing alone after a cut.

| What | How it works | Size and claims | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scissors** | Troops cut every fibre they see. Some units require every team member to carry a pair | Cuts lines already lying around: troops can't tell a new line from an old one | [Business Insider via Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-armed-scissors-cut-130657111.html) |
| **Rotating barbed wire** (makeshift, reported Oct 2025) | A barbed wire strung on supports, turned by a motor. Any fibre lying on it winds up and breaks | About 490 ft (150 m), on a battery and a small controller. It runs for a minute, then rests for a minute: 12 h a day. Set up by hand, so it protects rear positions and supply roads, not the front line | [Militarnyi](https://militarnyi.com/en/news/russians-discover-ukrainian-solution-to-fiber-optic-drones/), [Unmanned Airspace](https://www.unmannedairspace.info/counter-uas-systems-and-policies/ukraine-deploys-rotating-barbed-wire-fences-to-counter-fibre-optic-drones/) |
| **Chaharnyk** ("Shrub"), Logika Design Bureau (announced Sept 2026) | Hears the drone's motors and props, then motors pull hook-studded wires through a break zone | 31 in (80 cm) tall, like a livestock fence. Up to 330 ft (100 m) a unit and about 0.6 mi (1 km) linked. Reacts in 1 s. Claims at least 95% cuts after contact, from demonstrations. Run from a tablet in the Kropyva suite. "Dozens" sent to the front by Oct 1. Price, weight and power not published | [UNN](https://unn.ua/en/news/in-ukraine-the-chahar-barrier-was-created-which-cuts-fpv-drones-fiber-optic-cables-in-one-second), [RFE/RL](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-invasion-fpv-drone-defence-cable-cutting-chaharnyk/33867913.html) |
| **Shotgun** | Shoots the drone itself | Needs someone up and in the open, at close range | [Business Insider via Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-armed-scissors-cut-130657111.html) |

**What critics say about cutting fences.** A pilot who knows where one stands can fly around it. A single fence shows where the defenders are, and is a target itself. It can also get in the way of the defenders' own movement. Logika's head says: "We're not claiming that Chaharnyk will keep everyone safe" ([RFE/RL](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-invasion-fpv-drone-defence-cable-cutting-chaharnyk/33867913.html)).

<summary><span class="layer-title">Where the tripwire fits</span><span class="layer-sub">What our alert adds to a cutter, and what a cutter adds to our alert</span></summary>

- **The cutting itself is not new.** Chaharnyk and the rotating wire already break the line. A cutter of our own has to beat them on cost, or on doing something they can't.
- **What our alert adds: about a minute of warning, and knowing a drone is parked and waiting.** Chaharnyk hears a drone only as it reaches the fence. The tripwire hears it about a mile out, so the cutters on the right stretch can be ready before it arrives. On a road, the posts hear a drone land and wait ([Guarding a road]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link models/route-guard.md %})). Its line is then lying across any cutter between it and its pilot, with no rush, and cutting it is a sure thing.
- **What a cutter adds to our alert: something it can trigger with nobody exposed.** "Drone waiting near post 17" now leads to the cutter between the drone and its pilot running, not to a team going out with a shotgun.
